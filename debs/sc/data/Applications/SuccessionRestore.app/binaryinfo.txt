I'm guessing you saw the "ERROR! Unable to determine system information. Please follow the directions in /Applications/SuccessionRestore.app/binaryinfo.txt". You're welcome.

FIRST OF ALL: reboot and retry the installation.


IF THAT DOESN'T WORK:

If you're running iOS 10.0 or higher, delete /Applications/SuccessionRestore.app/SuccessionHelper

If you are on an iPhone XS, XS Max, or an iPad Pro that doesnt have a home button, or newer, delete SuccessionRestore32, hdik-armv7, and hdik-arm64, then rename hdik-arm64e to just 'hdik' (without quotes)

If you are on any other 64-bit device (the iPhone 5s and newer), delete SuccessionRestore32 hdik-armv7, and hdik-arm64e, then rename hdik-arm64 to just 'hdik' (without quotes)

If you are on a 32-bit device (the iPhone 5c and older), delete SuccessionRestore, rename SuccessionRestore32 to 'SuccessionRestore' (without quotes), delete hdik-arm64 and hdik-arm64e, then rename hdik-armv7 to just 'hdik' (without quotes)

If you're running iOS 9.3.6 or lower, you also need to rename SuccessionRestore to 'SuccessionRestore_' and rename SuccessionHelper to 'SuccessionRestore'
